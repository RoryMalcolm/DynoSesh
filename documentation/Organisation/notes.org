** Strategies
*** Extend class
    We can provide a superclass "Sendable<T>" which when extend would allow for them to be sent from a server via a send(Servable) method
    The sendable class could have a method entitled T getPayload() which would allow for us to retrieve the payload of the object... checked against the defined ProtocolStack
